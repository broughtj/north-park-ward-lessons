## The Godhead

Q: How do the scriptures help us learn about God?

- Start with Korihor and Alma
  + there are basically two possibilities
    - There is not God and this universe is an accident. This results in materialism and moral relativism
    - There is a God and the universe is devinely created. There is absolute moral truth.

- Joseph Smith's First Vision
  + One thing that I have always found compelling his Joseph's testimony
  + He says, essentially to us: "not only is there a God, but I've seen Him. 
    I spoke with Him. His voice was like thunder. His countenance was bright
    like fire, and His glory defies all description."
  + That's powerful to me!
  
- More from JS: D&C 130
  + Trying to picture God
  + He is a subtle Being. It is hard for us to really understand Him
  + But we know he loves us. 
  + The physicist Freeman Dyson talks about the "friendly universe" that we find ourselves in. 
    (It appears that God is a mathematician)
  + There is no time for God. 

- Moses's experience teaches us about ourselves in relation to God

- Alma 22:18 teaches us how to really pray to God! 
- Alma 32 teaches us how to come near to God. Crucial question: "Is not this ___real___?!"
- D&C 88:62-65 God's invitation to each of us
- D&C 93:1 all uncertainty will be erased and we will know for ourselves!
- 2 Nephi 4:16-32 Nephi's psalm
- Psalms 23 The Lord is our Shepherd
