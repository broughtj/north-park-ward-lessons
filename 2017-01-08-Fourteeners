## The Godhead

Q: How do the scriptures help us learn about God?

- Intro to BoM: a man will get nearer to God! What a promise! 
  It presupposes the existence of God (nb: so does Joseph's prayer)
  
- Brigham Young quote (sere [here](https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-brigham-young/chapter-47?lang=eng)):

> I never saw any one, until I met Joseph Smith,
> who could tell me anything about the character, 
> personality and dwelling-place of God, or anything 
> satisfactory about angels, or the relationship of man 
> to his Maker. Yet I was as diligent as any man need
> to be to try and find out these things (DBY, 458).

- Start with Korihor and Alma (Alma 30)
  + there are basically two possibilities
    - There is not God and this universe is an accident. This results in materialism and moral relativism
    - There is a God and the universe is devinely created. There is absolute moral truth.

- Joseph Smith's First Vision
  + One thing that I have always found compelling his Joseph's testimony
  + He says, essentially to us: "not only is there a God, but I've seen Him. 
    I spoke with Him. His voice was like thunder. His countenance was bright
    like fire, and His glory defies all description."
  + That's powerful to me!
  
- More from JS: D&C 130
  + Trying to picture God
  + He is a subtle Being. It is hard for us to really understand Him
  + Isaiah 55:8-9 
  + But we know he loves us. 
  + The physicist Freeman Dyson talks about the "friendly universe" that we find ourselves in. 
    (It appears that God is a mathematician)

- Moses's experience teaches us about ourselves in relation to God
  + [Moses 1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng)
  + We are his children!

- Alma 22:18 teaches us how to really pray to God! 
- Alma 32 teaches us how to come near to God. Crucial question: "Is not this ___real___?!"
- D&C 88:62-65 God's invitation to each of us
- D&C 93:1 all uncertainty will be erased and we will know for ourselves!
- 2 Nephi 4:16-32 Nephi's psalm
- Psalms 23 The Lord is our Shepherd
- [Moses 1:39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng36)
