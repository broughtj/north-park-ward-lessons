# Preliminary Thoughts


## Past Lessons 

This year I have taught the following lessons:

- Lesson 14: _Ye Shall Be a Peculiar Treasure unto Me_ (Exodus 15-20, 32-34)

- Lesson 28: _After the Fire a Still Small Voice_ (1 Kings 17-19)

- Lesson 30: _Come to the House of the Lord_ (2 Chronicles 29-30; 32; 34)


As I have prepared for and taught these lessons I have seen a clear message emerge from them that is coherent and powerful. Today's lesson continues in that process. I'm grateful to the Lord from showing me these things.

## Background Concepts and Ideas

The central scriptural source for this lesson is the well known verses in Amos 3:6-7

\vspace{2mm}

>  __6__ _Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be
> evil in a city, and the <span class="smallcaps">LORD</span> hath done it?_

\vspace{1mm}

> __7__ _Surely the [LORD GOD]{.smallcaps} will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets._

\vspace{2mm}

- It is important to start off right with these verses. The first big hint is that verse 7 is known as a Deuteronomistic verse (see 2 Kings 21:10). What does this mean?

- The word _Deuteronomy_ comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible known as the Septuagint, and it means _"second law"_ (see Deuteronomy 17:18). It was seen as reprise of Exodus, Leviticus,and Numbers, though there are some parts that revise and challenge the earlier understanding of the law.

<br>

- Deuteronomistic theology is conceived of as a covenant (a treaty) between the Israelites and Jehovah, who has chosen the Israelites as His people, and requires Israel to live according to His law - referred to as Torah. The prophets were seen as the guardians of the law. 

<br>

- To apply this to ourselves in our day (see 1 Nephi 19:23) we need to come to understand the Torah of Christ as revealed through the early Christian leaders after the time of Jesus (especially the Apostle Paul) and our own modern prophets (especially Joseph Smith). We will come to see that this was the __real__ meaning of the Old Testament concept all along and has been re-revealed in our day.

# The Lord's Secret Revealed

- One of the key words in the above scriptural text is the word _"secret"_ (_NB:_ notice that the word is singular and not plural). 

- The Apostle Paul gives us some crucial insight to this concept as taught by _the revelations of Jesus Christ_ in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10

\vspace{2.5mm}

> __6__ _Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:_

> __7__ _But we speak_ ___the wisdom of God in a mystery___, _even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:_

> __8__ _Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the_ ___Lord of glory___.

> __9__ _But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him._

> __10__ _But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God._

\vspace{2mm}

I personally prefer the simpler language of the NRSV:

\vspace{2mm}

> __6__ _Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish._

> __7__ _But we speak God's wisdom,_ ___secret and hidden___, _which God decreed before the ages for our glory._

> __8__ _None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory._ 

> __9__ _But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him:--_

> __10__ _these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everthing, even the depths of God._ 

\vspace{2mm}


- The word _"secret"_ as used here gives us insight about how it used in Amos 3:7. The word in this context comes from the Greek word _mysterion_ meaning "hidden thing, secrety, mystery." The word has religious meaning with the idea that one must be initiated to a deeper understanding while it is hidden from the common man.

- Why did God decree this secret ___for our glory___?

- Why does Paul additionally refer to Christ as ___the Lord of glory___? 

- These are hints. Paul guides us in coming to grok this inside meaning in the next verses. 

\vspace{2mm}

> __11__ _For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God._

> __12__ _Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are_ ___freely given to us of God___.
