# Preliminary Thoughts


## Past Lessons 

This year I have taught the following lessons:

- Lesson 14: _Ye Shall Be a Peculiar Treasure unto Me_ (Exodus 15-20, 32-34)

- Lesson 28: _After the Fire a Still Small Voice_ (1 Kings 17-19)

- Lesson 30: _Come to the House of the Lord_ (2 Chronicles 29-30; 32; 34)


As I have prepared for and taught these lessons I have seen a clear message emerge from them that is coherent and powerful. Today's lesson continues in that process. I'm grateful to the Lord from showing me these things.

## Background Concepts and Ideas

The central scriptural source for this lesson is the well known verses in Amos 3:6-7

\vspace{2mm}

>  __6__ _Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be
> evil in a city, and the <span class="smallcaps">LORD</span> hath done it?_

\vspace{1mm}

> __7__ _Surely the [LORD GOD]{.smallcaps} will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets._

\vspace{2mm}

- It is important to start off right with these verses. The first big hint is that verse 7 is known as a Deuteronomistic verse (see 2 Kings 21:10). What does this mean?

- The word _Deuteronomy_ comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible known as the Septuagint, and it means _"second law"_ (see Deuteronomy 17:18). It was seen as reprise of Exodus, Leviticus,and Numbers, though there are some parts that revise and challenge the earlier understanding of the law.

<br>

- Deuteronomistic theology is conceived of as a covenant (a treaty) between the Israelites and Jehovah, who has chosen the Israelites as His people, and requires Israel to live according to His law - referred to as Torah. The prophets were seen as the guardians of the law. 

<br>

- To apply this to ourselves in our day (see 1 Nephi 19:23) we need to come to understand the Torah of Christ as revealed through the early Christian leaders after the time of Jesus (especially the Apostle Paul) and our own modern prophets (especially Joseph Smith). We will come to see that this was the __real__ meaning of the Old Testament concept all along and has been re-revealed in our day.

# The Lord's Secret Revealed

- One of the key words in the above scriptural text is the word _"secret"_ (_NB:_ notice that the word is singular and not plural). 

- The Apostle Paul gives us some crucial insight to this concept as taught by _the revelations of Jesus Christ_ in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10

\vspace{2.5mm}

> __6__ _Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:_

> __7__ _But we speak_ ___the wisdom of God in a mystery___, _even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:_

> __8__ _Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the_ ___Lord of glory___.

> __9__ _But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him._

> __10__ _But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God._

\vspace{2mm}

I personally prefer the simpler language of the NRSV:

\vspace{2mm}

> __6__ _Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish._

> __7__ _But we speak God's wisdom,_ ___secret and hidden___, _which God decreed before the ages for our glory._

> __8__ _None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory._ 

> __9__ _But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him:_

> __10__ _these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches everthing, even the depths of God._ 

\vspace{2mm}


- The word _"secret"_ as used here gives us insight about how it used in Amos 3:7. The word in this context comes from the Greek word _mysterion_ meaning "hidden thing, secrety, mystery." The word has religious meaning with the idea that one must be initiated to a deeper understanding while it is hidden from the common man.

- Why did God decree this secret ___for our glory___?

- Why does Paul additionally refer to Christ as ___the Lord of glory___? 

- These are hints. Paul guides us in coming to grok this inside meaning in the next verses. 

\vspace{2mm}

> __11__ _For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God._

> __12__ _Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are_ ___freely given to us of God___. 

\vspace{2mm}

- See also verses 12 - 16.

- The Lord has taught this same lesson in our day in D&C 29 (verses which I haved quoted again and again in my past lessons!)

\vspace{2mm}

> __34__ _Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created._

> __35__ _Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual._

\vspace{2mm}

- The secret the Lord wishes to reveal to us is a deep - even hidden - ___spiritual___ secret. That is His nature. He wants us to understand Himself so that we can fully understand ourselves and our destiny. Our destiny concerns things unseen by the natural eye, unheard of by the natural ear, inconceivable to the natural man! In order to grasp the secret meaning we need to learn to see, ear, and think in a new and deeper way.

## Revisiting Past Lessons

- I have benifitted tremendously by tying these ideas to the past lessons that I have taught. 

### Lesson 14

- From Lesson 14 we remember the following:

	* Exodus 19. The Lord desires to show His face to the children of Israel. He gives Moses a commandment to prepare them to come up on Mount Sinai to see Him. They refuse.
	* Exodus 19-20. The Lord meets with Moses on Mount Sinai and gives Israel the Ten Commandments.
	* Exodus 32-34. Moses receives stone tables containing instructions from the Lord but breaks them when he returns and sees the people worshiping a golden calf (31:18; 32:1-24). The Lord takes the ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood from Israel and gives them a lesser law, the law of Moses (JST, Exodus 34:1-2). Moses hews new tablets of stone to replace those that he has broken, but the new tablets do not include "the words of the everlasting covenant of the holy priesthood" (Exodus 34:1-5l JST, Deuteronomy 10:2). The people covenant to obey the law of Moses (34:10-35). 

- In Lesson 14 I quoted from D&C 84 extensively. Here we remind ourselves: 

	* D&C 84:18-22. The greater priesthood holds the __key of the knowledge of God__
	* D&C 84:23-25. Mosel plainly taught these things, but they hardened their hearts and the Lord takes Moses from their presence.  

\vspace{2mm}

> __19__ _And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the_ ___mysteries___ _of the kingdom,_ ___even the key of the knowledge of God___.

> __20__ _Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest._ 

\vspace{2mm}

- The mysteries of God are made manifest in the ordinances of greater priesthood!


### Lesson 28

- Lesson 28 was about the activities of the powerful prophet Elijah. 

- 1 Kings 19. Elijah goes to Horeb (or Sinai) and receives a manifestation of the Lord.

\vspace{2mm}

> __11__ _And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the [LORD]{.smallcaps}. And, behold, the [LORD]{.smallcaps} passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the [LORD]{.smallcaps}; but the [LORD]{.smallcaps} was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the [LORD]{.smallcaps} was not in the earthquake._

> __12__ _And after the earthquake a fire; but the [LORD]{.smallcaps} was not in the fire: and after the fire_ ___a still small voice___.

\vspace{2mm}

- The meaning of this teaching is clear: do not look for God in the world, but within you! 

- I love this quotation from Meister Eckhart: _"God desires nothing more from you than a quiet heart."_

- Jesus reinforced this lesson in Luke 17 to a group of Pharisees who demanded that if he were a king that he show them his kingdom. He responds as follows: 

\vspace{2mm}

> __20__ _And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation:_

> __21__ _Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,_ ___the kingdom of God is within you___.

\vspace{2mm}

- We also remember that, sadly, Elijah slaughters the Priests of Baal (1 Kings 18:40).

- When James and John wished to call down fire from heaven upon an unwelcoming village in the manner of Elijah, Jesus rebuked them (Luke 9:54-55).

- This is instructive regarding the proper role of a prophet!


### Lesson 30

- In Lesson 30 my challenge to you was this:

	* What would it mean to ___conceive of the temple as a teaching?___
	* Here we also cited D&C 84 extensively and referred back to Moses and the children of Israel and Jehovah on Mount Sinai
	* I challenged you to look within yourselves for the sacred ground upon which to come unto God to meet Him face to face
	* I challenged you to seek God ___in the higher reaches of the inner being___. 
	* We referred to this as the ___cosmic mountain___: the sacred counterpart to Sinai/Horeb. 
	* We quoted from 1 Corinthians 3:16-17

\vspace{2mm}



> __16__ _Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?_

\vspace{2mm}

- Quotation from Jacob Needleman here!

- The hidden secret has to do with a true understanding of our divine spiritual nature. 



## The Role of Prophets Reviewed


- The role of the prophet is to do as Moses did: prepare the people to see God's face on their own. 

- Jesus Christ came to save men's lives, not to destroy them!

- C.S. Lewis til we have faces.


### A Warning Given in Modern Times

- An important warning has been given in modern times in D&C 121:39-42.

	* D&C 121:39. It is the nature of almost all men to exercise unrighteous dominion. 
	* D&C 121:40. Many are called, but few are chosen.
	* D&C 121:41-42. Persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned is proper order of the priesthood of God! Also kindness and pure knowledge. 

- If you think this does not apply to Old Testament prophets, or the prophets in our day then you have not done your homework! The Lord gave this warning for a purpose. 

- Sometimes we have a tendency towards genuflection and a tendency to deify our leaders in our culture. 

- Of course, our leaders should be supported and given proper respect!


## The Role of Prophets Continued

- Moses demonstrates the attitude of a genuine prophet in Numbers 11:29.

\vspace{2mm}

> __29__ _And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the [LORD's]{.smallcaps} people were prophets, and that the [LORD]{.smallcaps} would put his spirit upon them!_

\vspace{2mm}

- In Revelations 19:10 we read that _the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy._ 

- The Prophet Joseph Smith has said:

> _"God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them, for the day must come when no man need say to his neighbor, Know ye the Lord; for all shall know Him ... from the least to the greatest."_ (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith - Chapter 22).
