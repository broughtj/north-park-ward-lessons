# Teacher Council Meeting - 08/27/2017

## Teach the Doctrine

Today's session will focus on improving our skills in teaching the doctrine of Jesus Christ.

<br>

We will begin with some motivating scripturs

* John 7:16-17 "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
* D&C 88:77 "teach one another the doctrine" (it's a commandment!)

<br>

* Elder Packer quote: "True doctrine, understood, changes ..."
* Alma 31:5 "try to virtue of the word of God"

<br>

__Q__: What attitudes and behavior should we seek to change?

* Make a list of 5 - 10 items
* Make sure to _keep it real_


## Use the Scriptures

* D&C 42:12
* 2 Nephi 32:3

<br>

* __Q__: How can I inspire those I teach to "feast upon the word of God?"
* __Q__: What examples can we find of the Savior teaching from the scriptures?
* See: Matt 12:1-8, Luke 4:16-21

<br>

Nephi spoke about likening the scriptures to ourselves

* 1 Nephi 19:23

<br>

The Lord commanded the Nephites to search the scriptures:

* 3 Nephi 23:1-5
* __Q__: Why did He do this?


## First Exercise

Now we will split into groups of 2 or 3 and break out to come up with a brief lesson plan focusing on teaching the
doctrine and scriptures to address the attitude and behavior.

* Ask a few people to present

<br>

## Ensure Doctrinal Teaching

One way to ensure that we are teaching true doctrine is to consider how what we are teaching relates to the
doctrine of Christ.

* 2 Nephi 31
* 3 Nephi 27:16-21

<br>

__Q__: "How will what I am teaching help my class members build faith in Christ, repent, make and keep covenants with God, and receive the Holy Ghost?"

## Second Exercise

Now reform groups (same ones) and revise the previous lesson plan to focus more on teaching the doctrine of Christ.


## Scriptural Example

* Mosiah 5:2-5 
* Q: What caused King Benjamin's people to change?
* Q: How did what King Benjamin taught relate to the doctrine of Christ?
* Alma 12:32 (he taught about commandments after having taught them about the "Plan of Salvation")
* Q: Why does teaching in this order matter?
* How can we apply this pattern?


## Teaching with Authority

The Savior taught as "one having authority, and not as the scribes." (See: Matt 7:29)

<br>

* __Q__: How do we follow the Lord's example in teaching as one with authority?
