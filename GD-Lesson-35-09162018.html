<h1 id="preliminary-thoughts">Preliminary Thoughts</h1>
<p>This year I have taught the following lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lesson 14: <em>Ye Shall Be a Peculiar Treasure unto Me</em> (Exodus 15-20, 32-34)</p></li>
<li><p>Lesson 28: <em>After the Fire a Still Small Voice</em> (1 Kings 17-19)</p></li>
<li><p>Lesson 30: <em>Come to the House of the Lord</em> (2 Chronicles 29-30; 32; 34)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I have prepared for and taught these lessons I have seen a clear message emerge from them that is coherent and powerful. Today's lesson continues in that process. I'm grateful to the Lord from showing me these things.</p>

<p>The central scriptural source for this lesson is the well known verses in Amos 3:6-7</p>

<blockquote>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the <span class="smallcaps">LORD</span> hath done it?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Surely the <span class="smallcaps">LORD GOD</span> will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
