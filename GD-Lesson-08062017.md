## Quotes

Brigham Young  (_DNSW_, 9 Mar. 1867, 2).

> “When we arrived in Kirtland [in September 1833], if any man that ever did gather with the Saints was any poorer than I was—it was because he had nothing. … I had two children to take care of—that was all. I was a widower. ‘Brother Brigham, had you any shoes?’ No; not a shoe to my foot, except a pair of borrowed boots. I had no winter clothing, except a homemade coat that I had had three or four years. ‘Any pantaloons?’ No. ‘What did you do? Did you go without?’ No; I borrowed a pair to wear till I could get another pair. I had traveled and preached and given away every dollar of my property. I was worth a little property when I started to preach. … I had traveled and preached until I had nothing left to gather with; but Joseph said: ‘come up’; and I went up the best I could.”

Emma Smith (_Letter to Joseph Smith_, 1844, _Church History Library_)

> "I desire the Spirit of God to know and understand myself, that I might be able to overcome whatever of tradition or nature that would not tend to my exaltation in the eternal worlds. I desire a fruitful, active mind, that I may be able to comprehend the designs of God, when revealed through His servants without doubting."

Ezra Taft Benson (_BYU Speeches and Devotionals_, April 1977)

> "Celestial laws, embodied in certain ordinances belonging to the Church of Jesus
Christ, are complied with by voluntary covenants. The laws are spiritual. Thus, our
Father in Heaven has ordained certain holy sanctuaries, called temples, in which these
laws may be fully explained, the laws include the law of obedience and sacrifice, the
law of the gospel, the law of chastity, and the law of consecration."
