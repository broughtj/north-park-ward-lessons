James E. Talmage on the Spiritual Grandeur of Man (_Pearl of Great Price_, page 4)

I answer you: Potentially now, actually to be, he is greater and grander, more precious according to the arithmetic of God, than all the planets and suns of space. For him were they created; they are the handiwork of God; man is His son! In this world man is given dominion over a few things; it is his privilege to achieve supremacy over many things.The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork. (Psa. 19:1).

> "For behold, this is my work and my glory -- to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."

laws may be fully explained, the laws include the law of obedience and sacrifice, the
law of the gospel, the law of chastity, and the law of consecration.
